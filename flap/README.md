## This is an ongoing project on training an RL agent to master custom games implemented in pygame

It's an experiment to understand how RL algorithms adapt itself to changing game environemnts and if it learns to exploit hidden bugs in the environmnet human player could never think of.

currently, we have completed sprite based integration

Next Pending tasks :

- convert flappy_sprite_implementation.py in form of env object with modules :   step,reset  as in open ai gym
- Define Time based reward.. More time the better
- Apply different algorithms : DQN, PPO , ...

- Convert the game into multiple agent version
- Start work later on baghchal
